Open gitbash console in game directory, then type

	pyi-makespec your_game.py

Edit the your_game.spec file so that the 'datas' line reads

        datas=[("assets", "assets")],

You can also edit the console and name section

	console=False
	name="Space War"

(This assumes all of your game assets (sounds, images, fonts, etc.) are
 in an 'assets' folder.)

Now tell pyinstaller to use your spec file to create the exe. In the 
console, type

	pyinstaller --onefile your_game.spec

* For some reason .exe files don't like it when your font is None. You
  will need to include an actual font file for each font used in your
  game.
